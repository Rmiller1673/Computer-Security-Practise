\section{Task 1}
\subsection{How ARP Cache Poisoning works}
When a machine tries to communicate with another machine in a network, it will first have to identify it's hardware address. So it will first send a broadcast message similar to asking \emph{``Who is 192.168.121.2?''}. The machine with the IP address \emph{192.168.121.2} will then respond with an ARP reply packet, basically saying \emph{``I am 192.168.121.2. My hardware address is 00:50:56:e5:1f:0a''}\\


In ARP cache poisoning, the concept is very simple. The attacker simply has to spoof the ARP reply packets that would have been sent by the machine it is trying to spoof. Since ARP does not check if a previous request packet was sent, it will simply update the ARP records with each new packet it recieves. \\

\subsubsection{Known Values}
\begin{table}[here]
\centering
\begin{tabularx}{0.7\textwidth}{ | l | X | }
\hline
Type								&	Value \\
\hline
mac address of attacker machine		&	00:0C:29:41:88:70\\
\hline
ip address of attacker machine		& 	192.168.121.129\\
\hline
mac address of gateway				&	00:50:56:e5:1f:0a\\
\hline
ip address of gateway				& 	192.168.121.2\\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{Running netwox}
Tool 33 is used for this, to broadcast an ARP packet that \emph{192.168.121.2} has a hardware address of \emph{00:0C:29:41:88:70}. Tool 33 basically serves to send out an ARP reply packet and since the computer doesn't check if it has previously sent a ARP request, sending a new ARP reply to the target machine will update it's ARP table.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
netwox 33 --device "eth2" --eth-src 00:0C:29:41:88:70 --eth-dst 00:0c:29:95:fb:a1 --eth-type 2054 --arp-op 2 --arp-ethsrc 00:0C:29:41:88:70 --arp-ipsrc 192.168.121.2 --arp-ethdst 00:0c:29:95:fb:a1 --arp-ipdst 192.168.121.30
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Task 2}
\subsection{Mechanism of SYN Flooding Attack}
In TCP, there is generally a 3-way handshake before a connection starts, where the client first sends a \emph{SYN} packet, and the server then responds with a \emph{SYN-ACK} packet, and the client then ultimately responds with a \emph{ACK} packet.\\

In a SYN Flooding Attack, a series of \emph{SYN} packets are sent, and the subsequent \emph{SYN-ACK} packets from the server is ignored. This would result in the server having to dedicate resources to wait for the \emph{ACK} packets from the client.\\

\subsection{Using netwox tool to attack}
The tool used was tool 76, the SYNFlood tool, and was targeted at port \emph{23} of the target machine, ip address being \emph{192.168.121.130}, which telnet was listening to.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
netwox 76 --dst-ip 192.168.121.130 --dst-port 23
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Screenshot of half-opened connections}
\includegraphics[width=160mm]{task21.png}

When the SYNFlood attack was ongoing, the machine started to slow down and took longer to even just run \emph{netstat}.\\

\subsection{Changes caused by turning on and off SYN Cookies}
When SYN Cookie is turned on, when the SYN queue fills up, instead of waiting, it discards the SYN entry when it responds with \emph{SYN-ACK}. If the client does finally decide to respond with an \emph{ACK}, it then is able to reconstruct the SYN queue based on the information encoded in the TCP sequence number.

Hence, when SYN Cookies is turned on, the machine would be less prone to slowing down, and hence guard against SYN Floods.

\section{Task 3}
\subsection{TCP RST Attack}
TCP reset generally is a way for a machine to inform another machine that a TCP connection has terminated and that they can stop sending/recieving data. In cases where 2 computers, computer \emph{A} and \emph{B}, are communicating, computer \emph{A} might have crashed, and computer \emph{B}, not know it would keep trying to send more information to computer \emph{A}. When computer \emph{A} reboots, it would then recieve packets that it has no idea about, and would then send a TCP reset to computer \emph{B}. Computer \emph{B} would then stop take some other action depending on the software. \\

In essence, TCP reset will instantly stop a TCP connection. \\

In a TCP RST Attack, the attacking machine will basically forge the TCP packet from the sender, with the \emph{RST} bit set to 1, and send it to the target machine. This would then instantly result in the connection being dropped, and a new connection must be established to transmit data again. \\

\subsection{Using netwox tool to attack}
Tool 78 is used to launch the TCP RST Attack. Since for this machine, eth2 is the one connected to the network, it is the device used for this attack. \\

\begin{lstlisting}
netwox 78 --device "eth2"
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Description}
The video starts to play on the virtual machine with the IP Address \emph{192.168.121.130}. After the video starts playing, the attacker machine with the IP Address \emph{192.168.121.129} runs the above netwox command. The video on \emph{192.168.121.130} stops playing.
